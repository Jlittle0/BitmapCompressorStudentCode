| Nov 15  |  2:30-3:00pm  | Ideated about how to actually compress binary and what some methods were to get a 30% reduction rate. After the entire time, wasn't any closer to finding a good solution because everything just felt like it would take up more space to do than if I left the file uncompressed. Some ideas were to only keep track of the 1s since they were less numerous than the 0s but then that also required there to be only 30% 1s at most and just keeping track of their locations would take a lot of bits making it a bad compression. A second idea was taking chunks of numbers and saying like "16 0s" but to do that it would require there to be long strings of 0s and 1s and an efficient way to separate each different "chunk" which could be of variable size. Not sure where to go from here, will do more ideating at home. |
| Nov 18  |  5:30-6:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                Actually came up with a good idea for how I want to compress things. Very similar to what I was thinking during class, by having each string of numbers be represented but instead just take every 8 or 16 bits and say "15 0s" with a full set of 0s meaning the highest value possible given that number of bits rather than 0 because you would never want to say "0 1s". For example, if in 3 bits I can only represent up to the numbero f 7, I would have 000 mean 8. With this I would have to test how many numbers would be optimal so that I could do chunks of the same size every time. Will implement this idea next class. |

By using this data, I plan to find out the optimal # of bits I should consider as a "chunk" and represent in a shorter format while optimizing space. |

My first test on the 32x48 Q resulted in a compresion ratio of 700% while the test of mystery was 800 bits, but I don't think it was working in the first place. I didn't have enough time to spent more than the required amount for this problemset and as a result don't have functioning code which is sad, but I do think the idea I'm working on is good and that the methods I made will be helpful for the real solution. |
